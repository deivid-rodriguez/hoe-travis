=== 1.1 / 2012-03-11

* Minor enhancement
  * Added after_script support to .travis.yml and a travis:after task to check
    it manually.

* Bug fix
  * The check_manifest task is now run separately as an after_script to avoid
    pollution from generated files.  Run <tt>rake travis:generate</tt> to
    replace your generated .travis.yml.
